# DarkGDK-Revive-Project Part 2
These are work samples of me working with DarkGDK(Development Kit for Games)

Project Goal: Refresh my skills with DarkGDK(Development Kit for Games)

What is the value of this project? 
Previously I worked on DarkGDK back around 2009 when it was popular this is a very rare development kit for games but can still be applied today as its a Development kit for Games 
as supposed to just a Game Engine. This project was also good for keeping my coding skills in relation to games sharp as this is C++ strictly in relation to games which can be
applied to any development kit for games. Also Visual Studio C++ 2008 is still used to complie and load toady's games on PC and Consoles.

What did I learn that was valuable?
I now know I can make a game using a DarkGDK using coding references however there's issues with posting it on GitHub.

What are the issues with posting a full DarkGDK Game on Github or another source?
DarkGDK doesn't cover release software at least from what I know which would be just a game build similar to my Gamemaker 8 project which includes a release build runable on any machine which means file size could be large, viewers would have to recode file image locations, and in addition have to also wait for the possibly long DarkGDK download.

What will be needed in order to run this project?

1st download the "DarkGDK_Download.zip" unzip the file and follow the download instructions

2nd download the "DarkGDK Revive Project Part 2.zip" and follow the Program running instructions



1st NOTICE:This is Part 2 of the Project


Coding Reference "Starting Out with Games & Graphics in C++ by Tony Gaddis"

2nd NOTICE: All programs were still made from scratch in the DarkGDK kit
